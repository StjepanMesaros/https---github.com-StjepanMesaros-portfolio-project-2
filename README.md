<h1 align="center">Roll Those Dice</h1>

[View the live website here.](https://stjepanmesaros.github.io/portfolio-project-2/)

## Project Rationale
This is a mini game designed to test your intuition, patience and, above all else, your luck! The goal of the game is very simple; can you predict if the next role will be higher or lower than the previous one. The fun doesn't stop there! As this is, clearly, an RNG type of a game it can get very frsutrating and daring. With time you get better at predicting the throws but just when you think you've understood it, baaaam, you didn't. The end goal is to have fun while trying to outsmart a computer.

## Design <h5>[Back To top](#contents)</h5>

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -   The color pallete used was intended to give a classy and modern style to the website while maintaing minimalistic approach.
        <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/images/color-pallet.png"></h3>

-   ### Typography
    -   The font used is Bodoni Moda for text; sans-serif as a fallback font.

-   ### Imagery
    -   Images were generated by myself using MidJourney.

-   ### Wireframes
    I created wireframes using the wireframe [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#) website.

    The website has 3 stages, namely home page stage, rolling the dice page and a page if you lose the roll. The website is also prepared to reset the website, which show as a "Reset the game?" button to the user after failing to predict the next roll correctly.

    Here are the wireframes for each stage:
    -   Home Page Stage

    -   Rolling Stage

    -   Lost The Game Stage
