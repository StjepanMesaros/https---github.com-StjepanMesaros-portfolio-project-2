## Project Rationale
This is a mini game designed to test your intuition, patience and, above all else, your luck! The goal of the game is very simple; can you predict if the next role will be higher or lower than the previous one. The fun doesn't stop there! As this is, clearly, an RNG type of a game it can get very frsutrating and daring. With time you get better at predicting the throws but just when you think you've understood it, baaaam, you didn't. The end goal is to have fun while trying to outsmart a computer.
